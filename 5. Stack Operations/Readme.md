**Stack Operations**

**Overview**  
This folder contains Java implementations of basic **stack operations**.  
These programs are developed for **academic lab practice** to understand the stack data structure, which follows the **Last In First Out (LIFO)** principle.

**Operations Implemented**

1. **Push**  
   - Inserts an item onto the top of the stack.

2. **Pop**  
   - Deletes the top item from the stack.

3. **Peek**  
   - Returns the top item of the stack without removing it.

4. **Print**  
   - Displays all the items present in the stack.

**Files Included**
- **Operations.java**
- **Test.java**

**Purpose**
- To understand the working of the stack data structure  
- To practice array or linked list implementation of stack in Java  
- To apply the LIFO principle in programming
