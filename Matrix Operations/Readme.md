**Matrix Operations**

**Overview**  
This folder contains Java programs that perform basic matrix operations.  
These implementations are developed for **academic lab practice** to understand matrix manipulation using two-dimensional arrays.

**Operations Implemented**

1. **Matrix Addition**  
   - Adds two matrices of the same order.  
   - Each element of the resulting matrix is the sum of corresponding elements.

2. **Matrix Subtraction**  
   - Subtracts one matrix from another of the same order.  
   - Each element of the resulting matrix is the difference of corresponding elements.

3. **Matrix Multiplication**  
   - Multiplies two compatible matrices.  
   - The number of columns in the first matrix must match the number of rows in the second matrix.

4. **Matrix Transpose**  
   - Converts rows of a matrix into columns.  
   - Useful for various mathematical and computational applications.

**Files Included**
- **Addition.java**
- **Sub.java**
- **Multiplication.java**
- **Transpose.java**
- **Main.java**

**Purpose**
- To understand matrix representation using 2D arrays  
- To practice nested loops and array indexing in Java  
- To strengthen logical thinking for mathematical operations

**Note**  
These programs are written **strictly for academic and learning purposes** and are not optimized for production use.
