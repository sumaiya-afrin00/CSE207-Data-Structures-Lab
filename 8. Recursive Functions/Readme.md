**Recursive Functions**

**Overview**  
This folder contains Java programs that demonstrate the use of **recursion**, where a function calls itself to solve a problem.  
These programs are developed for **academic lab practice** to understand how recursive logic works and how problems can be broken down into smaller subproblems.

**Problems Implemented**

1. **Factorial of a Number**
   - Calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion.
   - Demonstrates base case and recursive case clearly.

2. **Fibonacci Series**
   - Generates the Fibonacci sequence for a given index using recursion.
   - Helps in understanding multiple recursive calls.

3. **Print Numbers from 1 to 100 in Reverse Order**
   - Prints numbers from 100 to 1 using a recursive function.
   - Demonstrates recursion without using loops.

4. **Print the Word "JAVA" 100 Times**
   - Prints the string "JAVA" 100 times using recursion.
   - Helps in understanding recursion with repetition control.

5. **Palindrome Check**
   - Checks whether a given word is a palindrome using recursion.
   - Demonstrates string manipulation using recursive calls.

**Files Included**
- **RecursionTasks.java**
- **Test.java**

**Purpose**
- To understand the concept and working of recursion  
- To learn the importance of base cases in recursive functions  
- To solve repetitive problems without using loops  
- To practice recursive thinking in Java
