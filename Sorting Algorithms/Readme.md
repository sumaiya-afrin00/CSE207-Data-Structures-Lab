**Sorting Algorithms**

**Overview**  
This folder contains Java implementations of basic sorting algorithms.  
These programs are developed for **academic lab practice** to understand how sorting arranges data in a specific order.

**Algorithms Implemented**

1. **Bubble Sort**  
   - Repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.  
   - Simple to understand and implement.  
   - Inefficient for large datasets due to higher time complexity.

2. **Selection Sort**  
   - Selects the smallest element from the unsorted part and places it at the correct position.  
   - Performs fewer swaps compared to bubble sort.  
   - Still inefficient for large datasets.

**Files Included**
- **BubbleSort.java**
- **SelectionSort.java**

**Purpose**
- To understand the working of basic sorting techniques  
- To compare sorting strategies and their efficiency  
- To practice array manipulation and loops in Java
