**Doubly Linked List Operations**

**Overview**  
This folder contains Java implementations of **Doubly Linked List** operations.  
These programs are developed for **academic lab practice** to understand dynamic data structures where each node contains references to both the previous and next nodes.

**Operations Implemented**

1. **Insert a node at the beginning**  
   - Adds a new node at the start of the list.  
   - Updates both next and previous links appropriately.

2. **Insert a node at the end**  
   - Adds a new node at the end of the list.  
   - Maintains correct backward and forward links.

3. **Insert a node at a specific position**  
   - Inserts a node at a given position in the list.  
   - Adjusts links of surrounding nodes carefully.

4. **Delete a node from the beginning**  
   - Removes the first node of the list.  
   - Updates the head and previous reference.

5. **Delete a node from the end**  
   - Removes the last node of the list.  
   - Updates the tail and next reference.

6. **Delete a node from a specific position**  
   - Deletes a node from a given position in the list.  
   - Ensures proper reconnection of adjacent nodes.

7. **Traverse and display the list**  
   - Traverses the list from beginning to end.  
   - Displays all elements in sequence.

**Files Included**
- **Node.java**
- **DoubleLinkedList.java**
- **Main.java**  

**Purpose**
- To understand the structure and working of doubly linked lists  
- To practice pointer manipulation using previous and next references  
- To compare singly and doubly linked list operations
