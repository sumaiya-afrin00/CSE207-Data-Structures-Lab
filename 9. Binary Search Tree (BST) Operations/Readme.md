**Binary Search Tree (BST) Operations**

**Overview**  
This folder contains Java implementations of **Binary Search Tree (BST)** operations.  
These programs are developed for **academic lab practice** to understand how BST maintains ordered data and supports efficient searching, insertion, and deletion.

**Operations Implemented**

1. **Insert an Element**
   - Inserts a new element into the BST following BST property.
   - Left subtree contains smaller values and right subtree contains larger values.

2. **Delete an Element**
   - Deletes a specified element from the BST.
   - Handles all cases: leaf node, node with one child, and node with two children.

3. **Search an Element**
   - Searches for a given element in the BST.
   - Efficient compared to linear data structures.

4. **Tree Traversals**
   - **Inorder Traversal**: Visits nodes in sorted order.
   - **Preorder Traversal**: Visits root before subtrees.
   - **Postorder Traversal**: Visits subtrees before root.
   - **Level Order Traversal**: Visits nodes level by level.

**Files Included**
- **BSTOperations.java**
- **Test.java**
- **Nodes.java**

**Purpose**
- To understand the structure and properties of Binary Search Trees  
- To perform dynamic insertion and deletion operations  
- To study different tree traversal techniques  
- To practice tree-based problem solving in Java
