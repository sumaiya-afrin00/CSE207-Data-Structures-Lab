**Stack Applications**

**Overview**  
This folder contains Java implementations of common **applications of the stack data structure**.  
These programs are developed for **academic lab practice** to understand how stacks are used in expression conversion and evaluation.

**Applications Implemented**

1. **Infix to Postfix Conversion**  
   - Converts an infix expression into its equivalent postfix expression.  
   - Uses stack to handle operators based on precedence and associativity.  
   - Helps in understanding expression parsing.

2. **Postfix Expression Evaluation**  
   - Evaluates a postfix expression using a stack.  
   - Operands are pushed onto the stack and operators are applied accordingly.  
   - Demonstrates practical usage of stack operations.

**Files Included**
- **InfixToPostfix.java**
- **PostfixEval.java**
- **Test.java**

**Purpose**
- To understand real-world applications of stack data structure  
- To practice expression handling using stacks in Java  
- To strengthen problem-solving skills using stack-based logic
