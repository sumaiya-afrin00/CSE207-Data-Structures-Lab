**Searching Algorithms**

**Overview**  

This folder contains Java implementations of basic searching algorithms.  
These programs are developed for **academic lab practice** to understand how searching works on arrays.

**Algorithms Implemented**

1. **Linear Search**  
   - Searches for an element by checking each element sequentially.  
   - Works on both **sorted and unsorted arrays**.  
   - Simple to implement but inefficient for large datasets.

2. **Binary Search**  
   - Searches for an element by repeatedly dividing the search space into halves.  
   - Works **only on sorted arrays**.  
   - More efficient than linear search.

**Files Included**
- **LinearSearch.java**
- **BinarySearch.java**

**Purpose**
- To understand the working of basic searching techniques  
- To compare the efficiency of linear search and binary search  
- To practice array handling and conditional logic in Java

**Note**  
These implementations are written **strictly for academic and learning purposes** and are not optimized for production use.
