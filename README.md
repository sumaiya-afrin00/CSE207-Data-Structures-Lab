# CSE207 – Data Structures Lab (Java)

## 1. Overview
This repository contains academic implementations of fundamental Data Structures and Algorithms developed as part of the CSE207 course.
All programs are implemented in Java to strengthen conceptual understanding and practical skills.

## 2. Programming Language
- Java

2. Selection Sort

### 3. Matrix Operations
1. Matrix Addition
2. Matrix Subtraction
3. Matrix Multiplication
4. Matrix Transpose

### 4. Singly & Doubly Linked List Operations
1. Insert a node at the beginning
2. Insert a node at the end
3. Insert a node at a specific position
4. Delete a node from the beginning

5. Palindrome check

### 9. Binary Search Tree (BST) Operations
1. Insert an element
2. Delete an element
3. Search an element
4. Tree Traversals
   - Inorder
   - Preorder
   - Postorder
   - Level Order

### 10. Graph Operations

2. Depth First Search (DFS)

## 4. Repository Structure
The repository is organized into topic-wise folders.
Each folder contains Java programs related to the corresponding experiment for clarity and maintainability.

## 5. Purpose
1. Academic laboratory practice
2. Building a strong foundation in Data Structures and Algorithms
3. Reference for revision and future technical interviews
