   - Matrix Subtraction
   - Matrix Multiplication
   - Matrix Transpose

# 4. Singly Linked List Operations
   - Insert at beginning
   - Insert at end
   - Insert at a specific position
   - Delete from beginning
   - Delete from end
   - Delete from a specific position
   - Traverse and display

# 5. Stack Operations
   - Push
   - Pop
   - Peek
   - Display

# 6. Stack Applications
   - Infix to Postfix conversion

    - Depth First Search (DFS)

# Repository Structure
Programs are organized into topic-wise folders for better readability and maintenance.

# Purpose
- Academic laboratory practice
- Strengthening fundamentals of Data Structures and Algorithms
- Reference for revision and interviews
- Only for academic and learning purposes
- Not optimized for production use.
